So far this repository is fairly unmaintained so I will set the outline as a guide for myself and also to others who come across this.

The goal of this coding project is to execute a listing arbitrage in live testing. The code is run locally from my raspberry pi. The basis of my testing and trading is off the hypothesis that new listings across exchanges leads to lagging (as well as a number of other phenomena) which results in minor pricing discrepancies across exchanges. Ideally I will then execute live trades across Binance, Bybit, and Kucoin, while also building out to decentralzed exchanges to improve performance.

Currently I am experimenting with a number of different approaches to execute these trades to identify potential strategies to improve my performance while also limiting API calls to avoid getting my IP blocked.

Currently this project is still in its development steps, though by the end of August I aim to deliver a minimum viable product.

If you are looking to track the progress of this project, the most recent work is done on the branch:
