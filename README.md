# Listing Arbitrage Project

## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing work to implement a live listing arbitrage strategy. The code runs locally on a Raspberry Pi, and the project is based on the hypothesis that newly listed cryptocurrencies often experience short-term pricing inefficiencies across centralized exchanges.

By exploiting these temporary lags and discrepancies, particularly on Binance, Bybit, and KuCoin, the aim is to execute profitable cross-exchange trades. Future improvements include expanding to decentralized exchanges to further improve latency and execution performance.

## Current Status

The project is still in its early development stages. I'm currently testing and comparing different execution approaches to find strategies that improve trading performance while keeping API calls low to avoid IP rate-limiting or bans.

## Goals

 1. Build an MVP by the end of August
 2. Develop and evaluate multiple trade execution methods
 3. Implement safeguards against overuse of exchange APIs
 4. Expand to decentralized exchanges (future milestone)

## Notes

This repository was initially unstructured, but it now serves as a personal roadmap and a resource for anyone interested in listing arbitrage. Contributions, suggestions, or feedback are always welcome!
